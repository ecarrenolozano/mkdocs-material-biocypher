## BioCypher design philosophy

[//]: # (TODO: Summarize this, reduce as much as possible the information here)
BioCypher uses a collection of reusable “adapters” for the different sources of biomedical knowledge, which can be flexibly recombined to fit various demands, thus reducing redundant maintenance work through quasi-standardisation. Integrating the controlled vocabularies of ontologies into the process helps to harmonise the data from individual resources and yields a consistent semantic basis for downstream analyses. Through unambiguous and simple “low-code” configuration, a reproducible knowledge graph can be created and shared for every specific task.
